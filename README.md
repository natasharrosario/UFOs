# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a dynamic table that organizes UFO data and has the ability to filter data based in certain criteria, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Results

The table was built using data stored in a JavaScript array and placed into an HTML file for easy viewing. I customized the webpage using Bootstrap, and equipped the table with several fully functional filters that allows users to interact with visualizations. 

Below is a screenshot of the completed webpage:

The page is clean, organized, and user-friendly. Data on UFO sightings can be filtered based on date, city, state, country, and shape. Pressing Enter on your computer after inputting the desired filters will display more specific data. An example is shown below:

## Summary

The webpage was created successfully and the dynamic table works as intended. One drawback of this design is that the chosen filters are too rigid, and therefore the options to search through the data are not broad enough. One solution to this would be to add more filters the user can choose from, such as the option to choose multiple, specific cities in one search or an option to select from different shapes. Additionally, if the dataset contained media, such as images or soundbytes, that users could also filter through, this database would prove to be even more dynamic and useful.
